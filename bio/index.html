              Grammy&#174; Award-winning artist T.J. Troy combines an eclectic knowledge of percussion from around the world with his innate musicality to create a distinct and powerful voice in the world of contemporary percussion. A prolific force in the studio or the concert hall, T.J. has established himself as one of the most multifaceted and sought after percussion artists in Los Angeles music circles. T.J. has performed at some of the most prestigious festivals of traditional and contemporary music worldwide, including the Sounds of Arabia Festival (UAE 2012), the Arab Music Conference (Egypt 2007), the Jerash Festival of Arts (Jordan 2007), the Territoria Festival (Russia 2009), and the International Book Fair (Mexico 2009). His voice and bass marimba performance on ensemble Partch’s “Plectra and Percussion Dances” contributed to the group’s 2014 Grammy® for Best Classical Compedium. He is Principal Percussionist for MESTO, an internationally recognized orchestra specializing in Middle Eastern Classical Music, and has received global recognition for his virtuosic performances on traditional Arabic Percussion instruments.
